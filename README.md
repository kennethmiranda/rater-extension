# RaterHub Helper

A Tampermonkey script that helps you manage tasks on RaterHub more efficiently. It tracks session times, gives reminders, auto-submits tasks, and reloads the page when no tasks are available.

## How to Use

1. Install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Add this script in Tampermonkey (copy the code or import it from the raw URL)
3. Visit a RaterHub task page and it will run automatically

## Configuration

At the top of the script, you can change the sounds for task alerts and reminders.

To enable email notifications, update the emailWebhookURL with your own Google Apps Script webhook.
